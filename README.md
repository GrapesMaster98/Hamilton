## What is Hamilton?

Hamilton is a CLI tool that helps you generate Discord.js projects faster, with a set of built-in templates, ready for you to use!

## Why did I decide to make Hamilton?

With the new changes presented by Discord.js 14 and forward, creating a Discord bot has become slightly difficult, specially if we take into account the extreme code changes that the D.JS team implements. A D.JS developer spends most of their time rewriting code and implementing changes rather than coding the actual bot.

Hamilton aims to aliminate the tedious task of writing the basics, allowing any developer to quickly bootstrap a project with a direct connection to a database and the latest features of D.JS. As a wise man said once: "It just works".

## Hamilton IS NOT

- **A framework**. This is a CLI tool that generates a template.
- **A library**.
- **Replacement for coding**. Hamilton is not a discord bot maker or builder, it generates a JavaScript sample, all the fun stuff needs to be done by you.

## Installing Hamilton

Start by running `npm install -g hamilton-cli` on your terminal or CMD, this will install Hammie globally.

- Create a new project by running `hamilton new <name>`
- Give your project a cool and original name
- Paste your bot token, this will then be stored in a .env file
- Done! You are ready to start working on your bot.
